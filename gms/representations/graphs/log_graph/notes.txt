why we put the implementation into the header files

-> There actually seems to be a bit of improvement :)
(0.00707 for -g 18)

branch prediction optimization for next()
- the common case should be in the if block
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3702903/portable-branch-prediction-hints#3702965
-> No (or very slight) improvement unfortunately (0.00709 for -g 18)


New observation: The speed matches the original implementation if we have k = 32

some measurements for -g 18 -n 1 -v:
    without parallelism:
        about 0.017 for kbit_bfs, about 0.013 for bfs
    with parallelism:
        about 0.0073 for kbit_bfs, about 0.0053


Lets try software prefetching:
