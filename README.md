GraphMineSuite (GMS): a benchmarking suite for graph mining.

This repository contains the code for GraphMineSuite (GMS).
GMS is a benchmarking suite for graph mining that facilitates evaluating and constructing high-performance parallel graph mining algorithms such as graph pattern matching or graph learning. It comes with a benchmark specification and offers a modular set algebra based approach to graph representations, set representations, preprocessing routines and algorithmic subroutines.

This public repo will only contain main releases. We will not actively push updates.
